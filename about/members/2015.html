<h1>Officers</h1><h3>Raphael Chang</h3><p>Co-President, Class of 2015 -&nbsp;Massachusetts Institute of Technology class of 2019</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I followed my friends into robotics, and I was amazed by the passion everyone had for science and technology. As I got more and more involved, I fell more in love with the energy everyone on the team shared.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I mostly work on software, which moves the robot and makes it behave the way we want it. I am also involved in designing the robot and designing some of the graphics for the team. As Co-President, I have to manage the rest of the team, making sure everything runs smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics made me love science and technology even more, and it made me even more excited about getting a STEM related job. I have also become friends with the coolest people I've ever met. I learned about teamwork and what working with a true team is like.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brent Yi</h3><p>Co President, Class of 2015 -&nbsp;University of California Berkeley 2019</p>

<li><img style="float: right; " title="" src="/uploads/media/2012/09/notjosh.png" alt="" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2012/09/notjosh.png" data-mce-style="float: right;"><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I sort of just joined on a whim. I guess if you try enough things, sooner or later, you’ll find something that you really love. (Robotics happens to be one of those things for me)</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>Mostly electronics, along with web stuff and things like the newsletter or art. Animation is always a blast to work on also. Off-season, I like to leech off the tools in the robotics room for personal projects. That's always fun.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>It’s really gotten me to realize that things like math and science aren't nearly as boring as they might sometimes seem: the things we learn in school are actually useful!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nikunj Khetan</h3><p>Vice President, Class of 2015 -&nbsp;Boston University class of 2019</p>

<ul>
<li>I was very interested in the idea of having to build a robot out of scratch using "real" materials. In middle school, I founded a Lego Robotics team with my friends. I was really interested in taking it a step farther from what I experienced in middle school.</li>
<li>I am one of the teams machinists and I try to involve myself in design work wherever I can.</li>
<li>Robotics has been a great learning experience for me! I learned how to handle huge machines like our CNC and how to use cool software for designing our robot like Autodesk Inventor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Patrick Dong</h3><p>Treasurer, Class of 2015</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I joined Robotics because I saw the club as a way to apply the topics learned in school.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>In addition to taking notes at meetings, I try to involve myself with scouting and design work.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has given me an invaluable insight into the STEM field, from working alongside mentors and other students.</li>

<h1>Class of 2015</h1><h3><br></h3><h3>Matt Wang</h3><p>Active Member, Class of 2015</p>

<p><img style="float: right" title="" src="/uploads/media/2012/09/Derp.png" alt="Matt" width="300" height="244" data-mce-style="float: right;" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2012/09/Derp.png"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I guess one of the main reasons I joined Robotics was because I felt like I could learn a lot from the experience. I had heard that it was a very cool activity to do, so I thought I’d try it out, and I really liked it, so I continued.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>In Robotics, I work mostly on literary parts of the team, including the team newsletter, grants, and the Because Robots site. I have a lot of fun talking about cool stuff that the team does, and it’s just what I like to do. Also, on certain occasions, I’m the Monkey mascot, so come and say hi!</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>I think that Robotics has more than anything taught me to apply knowledge, and to both work independently and to collaborate as a group. I’ve also made a lot of friends and had a lot of experiences that I probably would’ve never had otherwise.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>At first I joined robotics because many of the senior members were old friends from choir, however I became more involved after discovering how exciting Robotics can be.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I used to manage events for the team. On top of that I do scouting and any other tasks that I feel comfortable with doing.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has given me so many opportunities to learn and teach new knowledge to other, and now I want to continue to teach the next generation of engineers!</li>
