<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I joined Robotics after my brother had been in the club for a year and told me how great his experience had been. I had always loved tinkering with different parts, but I was completely taken aback by the level that FIRST and our team took things to. Joining the Funky Monkeys was definitely one of the best choices of my high school career!</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br> I am mainly a hardware oriented person on the team -- I have been a hardware subsystem lead for my past two years on the team and help out a lot with with machining parts, especially on the lathe. I also write awards, teach CAD to incoming members, and hold workshops for Miller girls..<br></li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>When I joined the team, I didn't volunteer for leading anything and was always terrified at the prospect of speaking in front of the team. Now, I am currently heading around five different projects at once and love presenting not only in front of the team, but in front of other teams, judges, and entire workshop rooms filled of complete strangers. Robotics has also taught me the value of STEM education and applying what we learn in class to solving problems. Over the past years, I have created strong friendships with this school's best set of intellectuals and great relationships with the dedicated team of mentors.</li>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/uploads/media/2016/members/Alanna Zhou.jpg" alt="Alanna Zhou" width="250" height="auto" data-mce-style="float: right;" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2016/members/Alanna Zhou.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>As a very clueless freshman with too many club flyers to count, I came across a very enthusiastic senior during Club Day that explained to me, whilst struggling to hold the yellow funky monkey banner up, how interesting the team was and how much I would enjoy it. Of course, I had already convinced myself that seniors were usually right, so I gave it a try. <br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>Because being a part of the team is constantly a learning process, I work on different tasks, be it trying to write code for the robot, help teach during software workshops, or doing anything discussed in a team meeting that needs to be done.<br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Since this area in STEM is lacking in the gender diversity department, it's been very eye-opening in terms of working and learning with different people. It's also challenged me to overcome imposter syndrome now and then, because starting off as an inexperienced member of the team can be intimidating at first. In a nutshell, robotics is a completely different field of interest that I wouldn't have ever tried if it weren't for that one sweaty senior on Club Day. <br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Jing-Chen Peng</h3><p>Officer at large, Class of 2018</p>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/uploads/media/2016/members/Jing-Chen Peng.jpg" alt="Jing-Chen Peng" width="200" height="auto" data-mce-style="float: right;" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2016/members/Jing-Chen Peng.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>When I moved to America in 2002, we rented houses in the bay area to live in. Our second landlord happened to be our current mentor, Mr. Xie. Back then, Lynbrook robotics was less "Lynbrook" and more "Garage", so I had a lot of exposure being in a house with people working on robots. I remember playing around with their spare parts, and even getting to keep some pulleys to play with after they left. (It fits well with Lego.) From that moment, I knew that I wanted to do robotics: I looked forward to the day when I could be a part of this robotics team, instead of just watching and cheering from the sidelines. Being a part of Lynbrook Robotics is truly a dream come true.<br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>As a member of the team, I show up to work sessions, workshops, and team meetings. During build season, I have helped to design conceptually, model in CAD, and machine parts for our robot. I have also dabbled in software, and am currently participating in the software workshops to learn more about how our robot functions.<br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Before Robotics, I did not have much of any experience working with a group of people. I tended to be the person who would find a project to pursue and just bash their head into it until it worked or I gave up. However, building a competitive, awesome robot is not a one-man job: In this club, I have learned to ask other more experienced members and mentors for help in solving problems I encounter. In addition to this psychological influence, I have also learned a great deal about robotics, ranging from the robot design process to how each and every part is made on machines. Last but not least, I have met many upperclassmen and freshmen through robotics that I otherwise would never have contacted, giving me an opportunity to talk with new people and make new friends.<br></li>
</ul>
