<ul>
<li><p class="question">Why did you join Robotics?</p>When I was young, I was a very curious boy. I would take apart small gadgets and electronics around the house, trying to take a peek at what was inside. When my dad noticed, he purchased me Electronics kits such as the Basic Stamp, Lego NXT/RCX kits and taught me the basics of electronics. I have become hooked ever since, creating small robots from the Lego NXT sets, participating in the FLL Competition and creating a club in middle school to share and collaborate with other students that liked robotics. The Lynbrook Robotics team was a natural progression from my interest and enthusiasm of robotics in middle school.</li>
<li><p class="question">What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</p>Robotics was a very great learning experience for me. We did many hands on and practical activities that we would never have done in our courses at school. I learned to become proficient at machining and creating parts out of blocks and rods of aluminum, and met a diverse set of new friends.</li>
<li><p class="question">What excites you the most about Robotics?</p>The most exciting part about robotics is its potential impact on the world and our everyday lives. From the fast and precise machines that assemble cars, to the nimble and steady robots that help surgeons perform life saving operations, robotics and the STEM field is becoming all the more exciting.</li>
