<h1>Officers</h1><h3>Shadaj Laddad</h3><p>Co-President, Class of 2018</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I got my start with robotics (and coding) when my parents gave me a Lego robotics kit in the first grade. Ever since, I've loved building and coding robots. When Lynbrook Robotics came to my middle school to present Funk Cannon, I knew that robotics would be a club to join.<br></li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I'm usually found on my laptop, coding up new tricks for our robots or testing them out. I also teach the software workshops, where new members learn how to write software for robots and get the chance to test out their code with our robots from past years. Sometimes, I help out with improving the robotics website.<br></li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>In today's world, robots are all around us. By joining robotics, I gained an understanding of what really goes on inside a robot, something I can use all the time. And with such a large team, I got to experience and practice the types of leadership skills needed in a professional environment.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Jing-Chen Peng</h3><p>Co-President, Class of 2018</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>When I moved to America in 2002, we rented houses in the bay area to live in. Our second landlord happened to be our current mentor, Mr. Xie. Back then, Lynbrook robotics was less "Lynbrook" and more "Garage", so I had a lot of exposure being in a house with people working on robots. I remember playing around with their spare parts, and even getting to keep some pulleys to play with after they left. (It fits well with Lego.) From that moment, I knew that I wanted to do robotics: I looked forward to the day when I could be a part of this robotics team, instead of just watching and cheering from the sidelines. Being a part of Lynbrook Robotics is truly a dream come true.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>As a member of the team, I show up to work sessions, workshops, and team meetings. During build season, I have helped to design conceptually, model in CAD, and machine parts for our robot. I have also dabbled in software, and am currently participating in the software workshops to learn more about how our robot functions.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Before Robotics, I did not have much of any experience working with a group of people. I tended to be the person who would find a project to pursue and just bash their head into it until it worked or I gave up. However, building a competitive, awesome robot is not a one-man job: In this club, I have learned to ask other more experienced members and mentors for help in solving problems I encounter. In addition to this psychological influence, I have also learned a great deal about robotics, ranging from the robot design process to how each and every part is made on machines. Last but not least, I have met many upperclassmen and freshmen through robotics that I otherwise would never have contacted, giving me an opportunity to talk with new people and make new friends.</li>

<h3>Elton Chang</h3><p>Secretary, Class of 2018</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br> <img style="float: right;" title="Elton Chang" src="/uploads/media/Elton.jpg" alt="" height="300" data-mce-style="float: right;" data-mce-src="uploads/media/Elton.jpg">I knew that I wanted to join a club, and I didn't know where to start. However, I had always been interested in drawing and making things, so when I the photojournals and the team apparel, I knew that robotics was going to be the team for me.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><div>As media lead, I create the newsletters and the photojournal, which is basically a yearbook for our team. I also help with other media related things, such as videos or anything to do with photography on the team.</div>
<strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong></li>
<li>When I first joined the team, I thought that I would be the kinda of person who machined and put together the robot. However, I've found my place in the team, to create artwork and media for it. I'm really loving this, as it is a good way to take my mind off school. Robotics is a place where I can relax and have fun with friends.</li>

<h3>Andrew Ng</h3><p>Vice President of Engineering, Hardware, Class of 2019</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I have been extremely interested in robotics ever since I had a chance to build a remote-controlled car with my uncle when I was in third grade. After seeing online videos of the FIRST Robotics Competition in middle school, I knew that I definitely wanted to be part of Robotics.</li>
  <li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>When it comes to building the robot, I focus on hardware-related tasks, including design, machining, and assembly. On the non-technical side of things, I help with trip planning.</li>
  <li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has not only helped me apply the things I learn but has also taught me to explore ideas on my own because even teachers can't teach you everything. It has also given me some insight on the design process and how an idea on the whiteboard turns into a finished robot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kunal Sheth</h3><p>Software Lead, Class of 2020</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>Programming in Java was a personal hobby of mine in middle school. But I always wondered what it would be like to work on a team. When I joined, I felt inspired by the upperclassmen and I decided that robotics was the club for me.</li>
  <li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I enjoy working with team members to write, test, and debug robot code. I find clean, maintainable, type-safe abstractions quite thrilling. When I am not programming, I am usually learning about our robot's electronics, getting help from mentors, or talking with designers.</li>
  <li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has had a huge influence on me. I never knew I would be interested in math. The team took me from only knowing Java, to the world of functional programming, type systems, Linux and more. Above that, robotics shows me the importance of communication, planning, and soft skills.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jonah Soong</h3><p>Event Manager, Class of 2020</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I joined Robotics because of my interest in STEM. I was also friends with several members, who greatly influenced my decision. The demos were pretty cool too.What are some of the things you do in Robotics? How has Robotics influenced you?</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I 3d design things and use machines. Don't forget inventorying! I also plan events.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has allowed me to make some friends and also learn a lot more about STEM. My CAD, machining and physics ability increased an exponential amount since I joined robotics.</li>
