<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>After driving the 2010 robot (Soccer Chimpbot Extreme) when Lynbrook Robotics was presenting at Miller Middle School, I was hooked. I wanted desperately to be a part of anything that was that awesome, so I signed up.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>On the technical side, I use the computer to model parts for our robots and other projects. Usually, I pass my designs off to someone else to machine, but I still enjoy personally using machines like the band saw and mill to stamp my ideas into metal. Outside of mechanical work, I have organized socials, fundraised for our team by working on grant applications, and served as a member of the pit crew and drive team coach, amongst the administrative work that being Co-President entails. I also regularly follow Chief Delphi, always listening and responding to what the other teams have to say.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>There’s nothing like working with a large group of very dedicated people, united by the desire to build a winning robot. Everyone brings some different skill to the table, and it is a privilege to learn from them. Not to mention what you get after the six weeks of build is over. I remember walking into the Edward Jones Dome at the St. Louis <em>FIRST&nbsp;</em>World Championships during my freshman year, followed by my meandering through the 400 or so pits, each one occupied by regional winners and veteran teams with some incredibly cool robots. The awesomeness and sheer scale of the competition is overwhelming, and there is nothing more exciting than being in the thick of it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I have been passionate about the fields of science and engineering from a very young age. Once I learned about this great program, I jumped at the chance to become a Funky Monkey!</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>As part of the hardware team, I participate in everything from CAD design to assembly. I love working with my hands and I thoroughly enjoy every moment I spend working on the robot!</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>When I was younger, I would be constantly taking things apart to see what makes them tick. As I grew older I seemed to have lost this curious nature. My participation in robotics seems to have re-kindled this love of learning I had as a child. Because of robotics, I always find myself asking the question “How does that work?”.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I joined because I thought that the Robotics Team would be a great opportunity to learn more about technology, engineering, math and science.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I plan events, organize events, update the website once in a while, advocate the team anytime and anywhere I can, build, help write grants and awards, teach new members, help with workshops, help design, take meeting notes at any meeting I attend, work hard, and try my best.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Life skills, writing, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math are all part of what I have learned in our robotics team. It’s more than just the robot, awards, and names; it is the friends you make and the lessons that I take from this club that keep me coming back for more. There is no doubt that I want to be involved in a STEM field in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I joined robotics because I saw the opportunity to learn a variety of new skills, from problem solving to public speaking. And also because to do so was “cool”.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>My biggest contribution to the club is on the hardware side. I enjoy working on the machines and assembling the robot. Aside from hardware, I also help out with awards, such as the website award, and the safety animation. Additionally, I help plan the team away regional trips.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has taught me to appreciate the simplest things, those which we take for granted, because now I see the ingenuity and cleverness behind their design.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p class="question"><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I initially joined robotics for fun. But as the year went on, I was astonished by how robotics members were able to give public presentations and build amazing robots. I decided that I wanted to be a part of that.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="question"><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>Some things that I do are building hardware/robots, publications, and event planning.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="question"><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has influenced me in a very positive way. I came from Taiwan to take high school in America, and I had no friends and could not speak English. It was the robotics members who gave me work to do and made me feel at home. As I became more involved, I made friends by working on projects and I learned the importance of teamwork. I improved my English skills by giving presentations. I learned how to build a machine from the ground up and how to apply school knowledge to practical use. Looking back to see what I have done, I am shocked; I have accomplished things that were far beyond what I dreamt of in my home country.</p>

<p><img style="float: right;" title="mc" src="/uploads/media/2013/12/DSC_7286.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="338" data-mce-src="/uploads/media/2013/12/DSC_7286.JPG" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>On a whim mostly. I was planning on joining Robotics, FBLA, and Speech and Debate in freshman year, but stopped going to the other two club's meetings after I got caught up in build season!</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>As historian, I create the newsletter, as well as document what's happening in the club, and keep track of the media. As well, I like to machine parts, assemble the robot, and just talk with my friends about the competition and other cool robots.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>It's opened my mind to things that I might have never thought I would be interested in; and taught me that there is so much more to robotics. It's one of the big commitments of my life that I have made because of the amount of time that I have put in, I always try and make the best of it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eva Lomazov</h3><p>Event Manager, Class of 2014</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br><img style="float: right" title="" src="/uploads/media/2013/09/DSC_5666.JPG" alt="" width="350" height="232" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2013/09/DSC_5666.JPG" data-mce-style="float: right;"></strong>First day of sophomore year... new school, new classes, new teachers, no friends. I can be anyone and do anything! And then, I walk into 7th period Java in room 608 and see this gorgeious machine, the "Moonkey" and of course i have to knw what it does! So I bother Mr. Pech and he says "Ask the robotics team..." September rolls around, I come to the meeting and decide that I have to make my own robot. So I stayed and I've loved it since.</li>
<li><strong>What are some things you do in Robotics?</strong><br> Though I am event manager, I don't just work on the administrative side of robotics. I know how to use most of the machines except the lathe and CNC mill (that's on my bucket list this year). I made lightening holes on our robot last year. I helped write the climber code for our "UFO." I also helped paint the robot. YAY COLOURS!!! Lastly, I am working on the EMC grant and writing articles. Oh and I guess I should mention that I do cartwheels in the monkey suit... (:</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br> Robotics has influenced me to view engineering as more than just a job or career but rather a hobby and passion. However, it's not just about engineering. Through robotics, I have met people all around the world with similar interests and views on life. It has taught me all sorts of skills from machining and coding to people and planning.</li>

<h3>Abhishek Johri</h3><p>Officer at Large, Class of 2014</p>

<p><img style="float: right;" title="mc" src="/uploads/media/2013/12/1076987_559853720742142_1348186594_o.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="280" data-mce-src="/uploads/media/2013/12/1076987_559853720742142_1348186594_o.jpg" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>Well ever since I was in 2nd grade I always made toys out of the cardboard boxes we got our milk in. Since then I have always loved building various things out of anything that I could find. Then in 2009 I almost got hit by one of the robots, Moonkey, when the team came to visit at Miller. I was hooked and wanted to be a part of a team that makes such a impressive robot from scratch.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I do many things on the team all using my hand. One is machining. Over the year I have become capable at using a lot of the machines such as the mini-mill, mini-lathe, and bandsaw. Apart from that I am also the team's Safety Captain and one of the many Photographers. I make sure that everybody has fun while being safe and I make sure to capture these moments when I take pictures. I also spend some time in the monkey suit from time to time at regional events. I organize many outreach activities that we do in the team, John Muir and Tech Museum Demos, so that I can help spread the word of our cause to as many people as possible</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has influenced me to do more in my community with robotics to help all kinds of people. I have become more outgoing than before, and more social. Through robotics I have found another group of people that share the same interest and motivate me to do more, a group that I can call my second family.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>When I was an 8th grader, I was told numerous stories about this enigmatic "Robotics Club". I like to try new things, so why not give the club a shot and be a part of the team? I joined robotics in freshman year, realized how much I loved working with the team, and here I am!</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>In the past year, I've worked on machining parts and event planning. I've also begun learning CAD. For example, I've teamed up with a couple of other team members to build a colorful sponsor display on our UFO robot. In addition, I've also planned the 2013 end of year picnic, which sparked my interest for event planning.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>The members of robotics have made me a better person. I've met many friends ever since I've been a part of the club. From these friends, I've learned to never give up on what seems difficult or impossible. I've also gained lots of knowledge while working on various projects, which I never knew could be completed by someone like me.</li>
</ul>
