<h1>Class of 2003</h1><h3>Henry Chu</h3><p class="gray">Co-Founder, 2002-03 Co-President - UC Irvine Class of 2007</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="question">Why did you join Robotics?</p>There was no robotics team to join when I first started. It all started with Christopher Suen coming to me during my Sophomore year and asking me if I wanted to be a part of something amazing, founding Lynbrook Robotics. He told me about the FIRST robotics competition and that he wanted me on board to help run the team. It sounded like it would be a lot of work, but a lot of fun too. It had been a while since I had gotten my hands dirty working on a project. I always loved woodshop back at Miller Junior High and would stay after school almost everyday to work on projects. I thought this would be a great opportunity to build something again.</li>
<li><p class="question">What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</p>The first two years we had a lot of work cut out for ourselves. We had lots of fundraising to do and lots of learning to do to catch up to the other teams. We attended various workshops held by other FIRST teams in the area to learn about the competition, the programming, the electronics, and on and on. During build season, we were constantly swamped with buying materials and building. We give a lot of thanks to Shesi's dad for leading the effort in design and construction of our first and second year robot. Without him we definitely would not have stood a chance in competition.</li>
<li><p class="question">What excites you about Robotics?</p>I was most excited about the fun I had building the robot, staying up to crazy late hours trying to meet the build deadline, and having a group of close friends around to share it with. And at the end of it all, you get to see a finished working robot that was once just a draft on a piece of paper. That transformation is awe inspiring.</li>
