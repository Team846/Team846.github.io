<h1>Class of 2013</h1><h3>Brian Axelrod</h3><p>2012-2013 Co-President - Massachusetts Institute of Technology Class of 2017</p>

<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I was left in awe after John Chai, the Co-President of the team from a few years back, showed me what the Funky Monkeys were all about. "Who wouldn't love playing (my definition of developing software) with a 54.4 kg robot?" I asked myself.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you did in Robotics?</strong><br>The part I love the most is solving technical problems in ways people don't expect, especially in software. Our robot picks up balls too slowly? No problem, we'll just make the robot autonomously correct its trajectory to get 8" diameter balls into a 10" wide intake while driving at 10 ft/s. I'm also heavily involved in member training including CAD workshops, mechanical design and administration of the team.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>The skills I developed in robotics have not only landed me two internships, but are representative of my growth as an individual from being on the team. I don't think anybody could have imagined me as a leader 4 years ago, yet now I'm a Co-President of a robotics team with over 100 members and heavily involved in many other clubs.</li>

<li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>I joined robotics for the wide range of opportunities it offered, environment I saw myself thriving in, and the whole team’s spirit and drive to succeed!</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you did in Robotics?</strong><br>I’ve been involved in Robotics since my sophomore year. Throughout the past two years, I’ve helped largely with graphics, designs, grants, assembly, and outreach. I was drive team coach this past FRC season and I had the best time discussing strategy while screaming on the top of my lungs.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has already gotten me an internship over the summer, and it’s only natural that I’ve been enjoying every minute of it. I’m an aspiring engineer and would love to continue what I’ve been doing on the team for the rest of my life, but I’ll always be sure to keep it funky regardless of where I am!</li>

<li style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why di<img style="float: right;" title="" src="/uploads/media/2012/09/BRProfilePic.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="287" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2012/09/BRProfilePic.jpg" data-mce-style="float: right;">d you join Robotics?</strong><br>I guess I joined because it sounded cool (you know how in cartoons they fight each other in mecha suits, use control panels with hundreds of buttons, and have holographs and sleek aircrafts? Oh yeah, and transformers.). I never saw any demonstrations, but the prospect of “robotics ” in itself sounded so full of action, movement, and possibilities…and I guess it seemed completely different fro m anything else I’d ever done. I don’t think I ever really did anything seriously science and engineering related until I joined robotics.</li>
<li><strong>What are some of the things you did in Robotics?</strong><br>I record our activities, write articles about the team, keep the website content updated, and make sure our newsletters get out on time. I’ve also worked on our 2012 Chairman’s Award video.</li>
<li><strong>How has Robotics influenced you?</strong><br>Robotics has taught me a lot as a person. In one aspect, being on the team has let me know that you can’t expect your teachers and others to teach you everything. Sometimes you have to go out and learn it yourself first.</li>
