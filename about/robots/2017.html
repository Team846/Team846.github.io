        <span style="font-size: 10pt;" data-mce-style="font-size: 10pt;">Drivetrain:&nbsp;</span>
    </strong>
    <span style="font-size: 10pt;" data-mce-style="font-size: 10pt;">This years drivetrain is a slight variation of our Funky Drive from 2014. This six-wheel drive has a slight center drop
        on the middle wheel, making it a west coast drive. The front wheels are omni wheels, which reduces turning resistance,
        and the center wheels are traction wheels, which allows for control. The drive gearbox has motors that hang over
        the wheels to save space for electronics on the interior. The single speed gearbox can drive the robot up to 15.5
        ft/s.</span>

    <strong>Shooter:&nbsp;</strong>
    <span style="font-size: 10pt;" data-mce-style="font-size: 10pt;">This year we tried something new with our shooter, designing a double-sided belt shooter that would pivot to shoot from
        different angles. From our calculations we found that a belt shooter could transfer more energy into balls while
        still maintaining a lower profile, when compared to the standard single flywheel hooded design. Another design requirement
        for the shooter was for it to be able to shoot from the two walls cornering the boiler, as to provide a location
        for shooting fuel safely into the high goal. We realized that a turret would need to rotate 150 degrees in order
        to meet this standard, so thus we designed a flip shooter that would have two positions for shooting. Such a flip
        shooter only needs to move ~30 degrees, ultimately taking up less space than a turret shooter.</span>

    <strong>Collector:</strong>&nbsp;
    <span style="font-size: 10pt;" data-mce-style="font-size: 10pt;">Our collector uses belts to pick up balls from the ground and move them to the ball storage. It also serves as an elevator
        that lifts balls from the ball storage up to the shooter. A pair of pneumatics deploys the front of the collector
        outside the robot’s bumpers to collect balls before the robot runs into them.</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Gear Collector:</strong>&nbsp;
    <span style="font-size: 10pt;" data-mce-style="font-size: 10pt;">Our gear collector uses a pair of clamping surfaces to pick up gears from the ground. It uses one pair of pneumatic cylinders
        to raise and lower itself, and another pair to open and close the clamp. It uses a linear slide to ensure the clamps
        slide smoothly, as well as using special friction surfaces to grip the gear as the robot lifts it off the ground.</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Climber:</strong>&nbsp;
    <span style="font-size: 10pt;" data-mce-style="font-size: 10pt;">Our climber uses velcro to capture the ⅜” nylon rope. A slip knot in the rope allows the climber to gather enough slack
        before climbing. The gearbox includes a torque limiter that slips when the robot reaches the top of its climb. A
        ratchet on the output prevents the robot from falling down. In all, it takes around eight seconds to capture the
        rope and climb, with the actual climb taking four seconds.</span>
