<p>Our team is very grateful for all of our mentors who have taken a great amount of time out of their lives to help us out. We are very lucky to have such a diverse group of mentors, each with unique skills and personalities.&nbsp;</p><h3>David Giandomenico</h3><p class="gray">Team Coach</p><p>David Giandomenico earned his Ph.D and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley, specializing in high voltage and power semiconductor devices, with a minor in numerical analysis. &nbsp;He received his bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at MIT, with a concentration in literature. &nbsp;Prior to college, Mr Giandomenico attended the Don Bosco Technical Institute in Rosemead CA, where he studied electronics in a four-year technical program.</p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/images/meetpages/2009/mr_g.JPG" alt="David Giandomenico" height="300" data-mce-src="../images/meetpages/2009/mr_g.JPG" data-mce-style="float:

Software, hardware, grant applications...You name it.</p></li><li><p class="question"><strong>Why do you participate in Robotics?</strong><br>I like showing the kids how to build things, especially when we use new methods, like hot wire foam cutters, or bending polycarb. I get a kick seeing a student go bug-eyed as they suddenly understand a difficult concept, like using op-amps to integrate, or when they use a propane torch for the first time. But I probably wouldn't still be doing this if I wasn't learning a lot from both the talented and enthusiastic mentors as well as the top students, who have brought me up to speed on web design and software dev tools. And finally, when I see how far these guys have progressed as they graduate from when they joined as freshman -- now that's really gratifying. That, and I'm a roboholic.</p></li></ul><h3>Yang Xie</h3><p class="gray">Team Mentor,&nbsp;Silicon Valley Regional 2007 Woodie Flowers Finalist Award</p><p class="gray">Mr. Xie has been a mentor on the Funky Monkeys since the team's founding in 2002. He holds a Ph.D in Mechanical engineering at KLA-Tencor. Mr. Xie's contributions as a mentor were recognized in 2007 with the presigious Woodie Flowers Award at the Silicon Valley Regional. He is primarily involved in Mechanical Design/CAD.</p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/images/meetpages/2009/mr_xie.JPG" alt="Yang Xie" height="300" data-mce-src="../images/meetpages/2009/mr_xie.JPG" data-mce-style="float:

I believe this club does things that the school cannot offer and I support its cause.</p><p class="question"><br></p></li></ul><h3>Ralph Lowd</h3><p>Team Mentor</p><p>Ralph Lowd earned his degree in electrical Engineering at MIT. He has had a programming career at IBM testing disk drives. He got involved with machining while working at a machine shop during the summers at MIT which paid for his tuition and by taking classes at De Anza. He first got involved with FIRST in 2001 with Homestead Robotics, where his son was a member. In 2010, he joined as mentor for the Lynbrook Robotics. Currently, he is mostly involved with machining. He considers himself to be a jack of all trades.</p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/uploads/media/2016/mentors/Ralph Lowd.png" alt="Ralph Lowd" width="252" height="252" data-mce-src="/uploads/media/2016/mentors/Ralph Lowd.png" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p><ul><li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>Initially, I participated because my son was a member of a team.

Its interesting to look at the game each year and predict how things are going to play out. Because I don't live close to the team anymore, I try to contribute what I can online by talking to members about my ideas and working with them on organization or written work. Recently, I helped the team start becauserobots.org, a website that highlights advancements in robotics technology.
