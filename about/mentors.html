<p>Our team is very grateful for all of our mentors who have taken a great amount of time out of their lives to help us out. We are very lucky to have such a diverse group of mentors, each with unique skills and personalities.&nbsp;</p><h3>David Giandomenico</h3><p class="gray">Team Coach</p><p>David Giandomenico earned his Ph.D and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley, specializing in high voltage and power semiconductor devices, with a minor in numerical analysis. &nbsp;He received his bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at MIT, with a concentration in literature. &nbsp;Prior to college, Mr Giandomenico attended the Don Bosco Technical Institute in Rosemead CA, where he studied electronics in a four-year technical program.</p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/images/meetpages/2009/mr_g.JPG" alt="David Giandomenico" height="300" data-mce-src="../images/meetpages/2009/mr_g.JPG" data-mce-style="float:

Software, hardware, grant applications...You name it.</p></li><li><p class="question"><strong>Why do you participate in Robotics?</strong><br>I like showing the kids how to build things, especially when we use new methods, like hot wire foam cutters, or bending polycarb. I get a kick seeing a student go bug-eyed as they suddenly understand a difficult concept, like using op-amps to integrate, or when they use a propane torch for the first time. But I probably wouldn't still be doing this if I wasn't learning a lot from both the talented and enthusiastic mentors as well as the top students, who have brought me up to speed on web design and software dev tools. And finally, when I see how far these guys have progressed as they graduate from when they joined as freshman -- now that's really gratifying. That, and I'm a roboholic.</p></li></ul><h3>Yang Xie</h3><p class="gray">Team Mentor,&nbsp;Silicon Valley Regional 2007 Woodie Flowers Finalist Award</p><p class="gray">Mr. Xie has been a mentor on the Funky Monkeys since the team's founding in 2002. He holds a Ph.D in Mechanical engineering at KLA-Tencor. Mr. Xie's contributions as a mentor were recognized in 2007 with the presigious Woodie Flowers Award at the Silicon Valley Regional. He is primarily involved in Mechanical Design/CAD.</p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/images/meetpages/2009/mr_xie.JPG" alt="Yang Xie" height="300" data-mce-src="../images/meetpages/2009/mr_xie.JPG" data-mce-style="float:

I believe this club does things that the school cannot offer and I support its cause.</p><p class="question"><br></p></li></ul><h3>Ralph Lowd</h3><p>Team Mentor</p><p>Ralph Lowd earned his degree in electrical Engineering at MIT. He has had a programming career at IBM testing disk drives. He got involved with machining while working at a machine shop during the summers at MIT which paid for his tuition and by taking classes at De Anza. He first got involved with FIRST in 2001 with Homestead Robotics, where his son was a member. In 2010, he joined as mentor for the Lynbrook Robotics. Currently, he is mostly involved with machining. He considers himself to be a jack of all trades.</p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/uploads/media/2016/mentors/Ralph Lowd.png" alt="Ralph Lowd" width="252" height="252" data-mce-src="/uploads/media/2016/mentors/Ralph Lowd.png" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p><ul><li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>Initially, I participated because my son was a member of a team. After he graduated, I was still very interested, and came to Lynbrook after meeting one of the members at an event.</li><li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><br>I work on mechanically related issues.</li><li><strong>Why do you participate in Robotics?</strong><br>I enjoy working on technical stuff and being around the kids. I also don't have anything better to do!!</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">Wes Harrison</span></p><p>Team Mentor<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant:

He worked for several companies during his 41 year career in the field of electronics. In his spare time, Wes has enjoyed traveling, climbing Mt. Whitney 3 times, hiking the Kalalau trail in Kauai, Hawaii, wood turning, and managing a tree farm in northwest Oregon. Wes discovered the Funky Monkeys in 2012 and has helped the team where ever he can since then. Wes passed away in 2018 and will be remembered by the team for his enthusiasm and passion for teaching. </span></p><p><img class="list-post-img" style="float: right" src="/uploads/media/2016/Mr.Harrison.jpg" alt="Wes Harrison" width="auto" height="300" data-mce-src="/uploads/media/2016/Mr.Harrison.jpg" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p><ul style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal;" data-mce-style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight:

I am now "officially" retired. I&nbsp;try to help the students wherever I can. Sometimes it is with lab organization, fabricating parts, testing, or making sure the equipment is operated safely.</li><li><strong>Why do you participate in Robotics?</strong><br>I enjoy helping the students learn the myriad of skills that are acquired in Robotics lab.&nbsp;For most students in today's world, Robotics will be the only place where they can learn these skills. It's a unique opportunity for them to be able to participate in the design and&nbsp;building of a highly functional robot.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;

He has programed, set up, and run CNC mills and manual mills and lathes. Today, Payton is a trauma critical care trained nurse and works in organ donation. He earned his Baccalaureate in Nursing from San Jose State University. Payton began his relationship with Funky Monkeys in 2004 by making a few parts for the robot that year, Bikebot. Soon after, he began mentoring a few students in machining at his (then) employer's in-house machine shop and continues to do so today in the Team's machine shop.</span></p><ul><li><strong>Why did you join Robotics?</strong><br>Stephen Giandomenico's mother asked if I would help machine some components for Stephen's robotics team.</li><li><strong>What are some of the things you do in Robotics?</strong><div id="_mcePaste">a. Monopolize a seat during meetings.</div><div id="_mcePaste">b.
