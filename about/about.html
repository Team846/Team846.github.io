<p>Lynbrook Robotics,
    <em>&#65279;FIRST</em>&#65279; Team 846&nbsp;provides motivated students with the opportunities to excel in science,
    technology and business. Founded in 2001, Lynbrook Robotics operates within Lynbrook High School, a public school
    located in San Jose, CA in the heart of Silicon Valley. Our team is a student run, extracurricular organization
    with over one hundred members and has been operating for twelve years. Through participating in the
    <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition, our robotics program introduces students to engineering and helps them develop
    the skills they need to manage a complex project involving many individuals with talents in software, electronics,
    mechanics, and art. Our vision, in the words of Dean Kamen, founder of
    <em>FIRST</em>:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Our Mission</h2>
<p>Lynbrook Robotics aims to inspire students and members of the local community to explore science, technology, engineering,
    and math (STEM) fields of study. With hands-on activities, students are able to apply their "book knowledge"
    to solve real life problems. Students can't be expected to learn how to swim by simply being told, "rotate your
    arms and kick your feet!" Instead, they have to try it out in the pool. Our team provides that "pool" for students
    to practice the skills learned in math, physics, and even literature classes. Members develop many skills while
    participating on the team, including:</p>
