<p>Our team participates in more than just the FRC competition. We are always looking for opportunities to give back to the community. We enjoy sharing the knowledge that we have gained from competitions with other robotics teams. We also step out of the robotics boundaries and also find ways to give back to our community by volunteering.</p>

<p>Because Robots! is an exciting new program started by Lynbrook Robotics. It involves campaigning throughout our community in places like schools and shopping malls while spreading our interest of robotics to all people. We think that a program like this can help quantify the impact we have on people, because it really gets them to think about robots and technology, and then gives us a reminder about the people we affected. Wherever there are people to be inspired, we will be there!</p>

<h4><a href="http://millerxbots.com/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="millerxbots.com"><em>FIRST</em> Lego League</a></h4><p>Every year, Lynbrook Robotics mentors local FLL teams from Miller Middle School and Dilworth Elementary School. LRT members work with younger students to build and program a fully functional robot to complete the FLL missions. Mentoring younger students is a great way to not only inspire students in STEM fields, but also to give LRT members a great opportunity to teach and share their robotics knowledge with others. The teams that LRT mentored all do well at their respective competitions.</p>

<p>Lynbrook Robotics members drive out to Oak Grove High school to mentor their Botball team. LRT helps the Oak Grove Eaglebots build a Lego robot and program that Lego robot, along with a Roomba, to accomplish certain tasks. The Eaglebots have won their regional competitions and have gone to nationals in the past few years.

<h4><a href="?act=wrrf" target="_blank" data-mce-href="?act=wrrf">WRRF Workshops</a></h4><p>The Funky Monkeys also give a presentation about robot subsystems at the WRRF workshops each year. This talk touches on topics such as pneumatics, robot drive trains, electronics and sensors. These workshops allow team members to teach not only Lynbrook Robotics members, but also other robotics teams.</p>

Members worked hard for several hours, matching the children's wish list with what they had available at the event and running over to grab it from a warehouse full of toys.

<h4><a href="http://www.thetech.org/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.thetech.org/">The Tech Museum</a></h4><p>Our team regularly volunteers at The Tech Museum in downtown San Jose, helping young children gain experience and interest in science and technology. Every month, we volunteer at the exhibit of the PR2, a humanoid robot. We teach interested children and parents how to operate the robot and how the robot works.</p>
