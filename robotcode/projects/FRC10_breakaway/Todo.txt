KEY -------------------------------------------------
- Need to implement
~ In progress [add name]
& Testing
/ Completed
-----------------------------------------------------

/ Move roller enabling into the autonomous init, and allow the state to carry through 
	into teleop. Roller should not be enabled in teleopinit
/ Fix the operator buttons 7, 9, 11 to not work when config button is pressed
/ Make sure that service mode enters and exits properly.
/ Make the SavePreset functions save the config file.
/ remove lift and arm tolerance
/ Add buttons/functionality to retract/lower lift and arm
/ Make a dump of the SVN repo
/ Setup SVN Serve for a repo on the LAN.
/ Remove base positions...
/ Confirm polarity of the kicker relay
/ Refine the lift and arm pot limits.
/ Kill oscillation when overshoot arm
/ Service mode preset testing doesn't work since we disable ApplyOutput..
  {dcl: just eliminated those buttons. we don't need them}
/ Low power test mode
/ STOP BUTTON for lift/arm presets. And kicker.
	/ Add functionality and buttons to abort lift operations
	/ Add functionality and buttons to disable the kicker
/ Lower lift threshold on arm lowering.
/ Figure out the driving lag
	/ does it have to do with printing??
	/ To test: put bot on cart, deploy code, disconnect PC, drive for a while.
/ Threading CAN output
	ProxiedCANJaguar: public SpeedController
		float Get();
		void Set(float val);
		float GetCurrent(); // return 0...
	CANBusController
		float m_setpoint[kMaxJaguarID+1];
		float Get(int id);
		void Set(int id, float val);
		float GetCurrent(int id);
/ Find encoder max speed = 3333 at San Diego

Low Priority
- Come up with a systematic method to configure all the presets.
- Make sure encoders are even (clean wheels inside them)
- SafeCANJaguar can't seem to recover after reconnected even though it sees voltage

- Set ArmMiddle preset.
- Tune roller speed.
- Disable the roller for about 1/4 second while kicking.
- Remove the mechanical deadband on the roller.

TEST
& Switch to DigitalOutputBrakes...
& New button mappings
 - arm up/down with operatorstick
