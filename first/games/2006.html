<p>Aim High was the 2006 game for the
    <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition. The competition involved teams competing to gain points by delivering balls into goals
    and positioning their robots in certain positions on the playing field. The teams took it in turn to provide defence
    and attack. Aim High is played by two alliances, red and blue, each consisting of three robots. During a 10 second autonomous
    mode robots are programmed to score into any of the three goals: one raised center goal marked by a green vision target
    and two corner goals at floor level. At the end of the autonomous period the alliance with the most points will gain
    a 10 point bonus and will be placed on defense for round two. Rounds two, three and four are each 40 seconds long and
    are human-controlled rounds. Between rounds two and three the alliances switch from offense to defense or vice versa.
    At the start of round 4 any alliance can score into the corresponding goals. At the end of the match any alliance can
    receive bonus points by placing its three robots on a platform below the center goal. The alliance with the most points
    wins with scoring as follows: 3 points for any ball scored in the center goal, 1 point for any ball scored in the corner
    goals, 10 bonus points for scoring the highest in the autonomous round and 25 points for placing all 3 robots on the
    platform at the end (10 points for 2 robots and 5 points for 1 robot).</p>
