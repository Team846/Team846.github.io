        <em>FIRST</em> Frenzy: Raising the Bar was the 2004 game for the
        <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition. The game included elements from previous years' games, including mobile goals, "capping"
        goals with large inflatable balls, and others. In Raising the Bar, teams could score by having their human player score
        purple balls in any of the goals, capping the goals with a multiplier ball, or hanging their robot suspended from the
        10-foot (3.0 m) high 'chin up bar'. In the qualifying matches, Teams competed in 2-member randomly generated alliances.
        In the elimination rounds, 3-member alliances competed against each other with one team sitting out each match. The alliance
        that won two matches advanced in the tournament.&nbsp; Teams were given 5 points for every small purple ball contained
        within any of the goals. The 4 small yellow balls that started on the posts were each worth 10 points when contained
        in any goal. Teams could double the score of any given goal by placing a large yellow ball on top of it. Finally, teams
        could end the match hanging from the chin-up bar for a 50 point bonus at the end of the match.</p>
