<p>AERIAL ASSIST is played by two competing Alliances of three robots each on a flat 25’ x 54’ foot field, straddled by a truss
    suspended just over five feet above the floor. The objective is to score as many balls in goals as possible during a
    two (2)-minute and 30-second match. The more Alliances score their ball in their goals, and the more they work together
    to do it, the more points their Alliance receives.</p>
