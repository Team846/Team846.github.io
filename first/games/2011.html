<p>Logo Motion, played on a 27 x 54 ft field, challenges robots to create FIRST logos on walls. Opposing alliances of three
    robots try to score as many points as possible by placing inflatable pool tubes shaped as elements of the FIRST logo
    onto a scoring rack on their side of the field. Alliances earn more points by arranging the game pieces on the rack such
    that they form the FIRST logo, or by placing Ubertubes on the rack during the autonomous period. In the finale of the
    game, teams can earn big points with their deployable minibots, which must climb up a 10 ft pole as quickly as possible.</p>
