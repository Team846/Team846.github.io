<p>Triple Play is the name of the 2005 season
    <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition game. This game was the first to feature three robots per alliance. The primary game
    pieces were called "Tetras" which are tetrahedra made from 1.25 in (31.8 mm) PVC pipe 30 in (762 mm) long. The game was
    played on a field set up like a tic-tac-toe board, with nine larger goals, also shaped as tetras in three rows of three.
    The object of the game was to place the scoring tetras on the larger goals, creating rows of three by having a tetra
    of your allianceâ€™s color at the highest point on the goal. Triple Play was a strategically intensive game, requiring
    quick thinking on the part of the drivers and operators to optimize the field for their alliance. Tetras scored on the
    top of a goal were worth 3 points, while tetras contained inside the goals were worth 1 point. A goal was "owned" by
    the alliance whose color tetra highest on or inside the goal. Rows of three owned goals garnered the alliance an additional
    10 points per at the end of regulation play. Ten points could also be scored if all three alliance robots were behind
    the alliance line at their end of the field at the end of the game.</p>
