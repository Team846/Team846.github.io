<p>Zone Zeal is the 2002 game for the
    <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;Robotics Competition. In it, robots playing in alliances of 2 competed to move goals and balls into various
    zones within the playing field. The playing field was divided into fifths called zones. At the beginning of the match,
    there were 40 balls arranged along the sides of the field in the center zone and the two adjacent zones. In the center
    zone were three mobile goals. The zones were numbered 1 through 5. The Blue team could score by placing ball-filled goals
    in zones 4 or 5, and could score a bonus 10 points for every goal in zone 4. At the end of the match, for every robot
    Blue had in zone 1, Blue would score 10 points. For the red alliance, it was the opposite. Balls could be scored in zones
    1 or 2, goals would receive bonus points for being in zone 2, and robots scored 10 points each for ending the match in
    zone 5.</p>
