<p>The Rebound Rumble robotics game is played between two alliances of three teams each. Each Alliance competes by trying to
    score as many of the basketballs in the hoops as possible during the 2-minute and 15-second match. Balls scored in higher
    hoops score Alliances more points. Alliances are awarded bonus points if they are balanced on bridges at the end of the
    match. In matches where opponent Alliances work together to balance on the white bridge, all participating teams earn
    additional valuable seeding points.</p>

<p>Our solution to Rebound Rumble was to use a grooved wheel shooter and a curved wedge to push down the bridge. Learn more
