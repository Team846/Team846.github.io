<p>Stack Attack is the game for the 2003
    <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition. In Stack Attack, two teams of two robots each attempt to win by moving large Sterilite
    bins into their zone and arranging them into stacks. At the beginning of the match, each team is given 4 bins, which
    they may arrange as they see fit. Each of these bins are marked with a retroreflective tape that is highly visible to
    the infrared sensors included in the kit of parts. In the center of the field on top of the ramp is a large stack of
    29 bins. The object of this game is for each two player alliance to rack up more points than the other team. Scoring
    is one point for every bin in an alliance's scoring zone the bins in their highest stack, multiplied by the height of
    their highest stack. Each robot on the top of the ramp at the end of the match adds 25 points to an alliance's score.
    Bins that are supported by a robot do not count towards the final score.</p>
