<p>Ultimate Ascent is played between two alliances of three teams each. During the match, each scores by throwing discs into
    3 levels of slots during the 2-minute and 15-second match. Discs scored in higher slots score Alliances more points.
    Bonus points are awarded if alliances climb up a pyramid at the end of the match. The pyramid has three rungs worth more
    points based on level of ascent at the end of the match. It also contains a goal at the peak worth extra points.</p>
