<p>Diabolic Dynamics is the 2001 game for the
    <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition. The playing field is a carpeted, rectangular area. Dividing the field in half is an
    18 inch high railing with a central bridge, which can tilt to either side of the field or remain level. Two 7 foot tall
    high movable goals begin on opposite sides of the field. At the start of each match, the alliance station contains twenty
    small balls. An additional twenty small balls and four large balls are located at the far end of the playing field. Each
    match is a maximum of two minutes lon. Alliances can end the match at any time.&nbsp;Alliances score one point for each
    small ball in the goal, ten points for each large ball in the goal, ten points for each robot in the End Zone, and ten
    points if the stretcher is in the End Zone. The alliance doubles its score for each goal that is on the bridge if the
    bridge is balanced, and multiplies its score by a factor of up to three by ending the match before the two minute time
    limit. Each team receives the alliance score. A team multiplies its score by 1.1 if its large ball is on top of a goal.
    Scores are rounded up to the nearest whole point after applying all multipliers.</p>
