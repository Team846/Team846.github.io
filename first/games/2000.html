<p>Co-Opertition
    <em>FIRST</em> is the 2000 game for the
    <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition.&nbsp;The playing field was a carpeted, rectangular area with two 6 feet high goals located
    midfield, one goal for each alliance. There is a 30 inch tall clearance bar under each goal. Between the goals is an
    8 feet wide ramp with a 5 feet tall clearance bar, which robots may hang on to score points.&nbsp;Each match is two minutes
    long. Alliances receive one point for each yellow ball and five points for each black ball in their goal, and not in
    contact with their robot. Robots that are completely on the ramp each earn five points for their alliance. A robot hanging
    from the horizontal bar connecting the two goals earns ten points for its alliance.</p>
