        <em>
            <strong>FIRST</strong>
        </em> (
        <em>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</em>)</a> is a non-profit organization which was founded
    in 1989 by Dean Kamen, better known as the inventor of the Segway Human Transporter.&nbsp;
    <em>FIRST</em> encourages its participants to embrace science, engineering, and technology by engaging bright young minds
    in cooperative and creative problem solving, while upholding the ideal of Gracious Professionalism
    <sup>®</sup>. Part of the very foundation of this organization, Gracious Professionalism
    <sup>®</sup> is a principle of
    <em>FIRST </em>that adovcates diligence, integrity, and friendly competition. Through such beliefs, the
    <em>FIRST </em>community looks to further utilize STEM as a vehicle to create well-rounded future leaders proficient both
    in knowledge and in communication.</p>

    <em>FIRST </em>annually hosts a competition in which thousands of teams from all over the world, encompassing hundreds of
    thousands of students, compete in an intense program which is a test of ingenuity and tenacity.</p>
<p>Each team builds a robot designed to participate in a type of arena game, the parameters of which are changed every year
    and require the robots to have certain functions that allow them to compete. The robots must be built within a period
    of six weeks, and are then used in competitions which are held all over the country.</p>
<p>Students are exposed to the process of design, fabrication, assembly and testing, as well as repair and troubleshooting;
    and have the opportunity to use computer aided design software and programming languages. The program is an excellent
    tool that the involved engineers and corporate sponsors use to prepare the next workforce.</p>

    <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;has partnered with The LEGO
    <sup>®</sup> Group to host an annual robotics competition for younger students. The competition is designed to help younger
    students gain experience in science and technology and teach them employment and life skills.
    <br>
</p>
<p>Each team is mentored by an adult coach and older students, many from local FRC teams. They build a robot using the&nbsp;LEGO
    <sup>®</sup> MINDSTORMS
    <sup>®</sup> robot set based on a game that
    <em>FIRST</em> releases every year. They then attend FLL tournaments.</p>
<p>FLL teaches young students the skills of designing and building robots, as well as basic programming logic. The&nbsp;
    <em>FIRST</em> LEGO
    <sup>®</sup> League prepares students for bigger challenges in science and technology as they grow older.</p>
