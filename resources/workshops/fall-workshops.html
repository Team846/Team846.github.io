</p>
<p>In a 6 week series of workshops by Lynbrook Robotics members, rookie members learn the skills needed to contribute to the
    robot during build season.</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Animation</strong>
</h4>
<p>The workshop series helps members learn to use Autodesk Maya, a 3D computer graphics software. Students develop skills needed
    to help produce an animation entry for the annual FIRST Safety Animation Competition.
    <em>Presented by student Brian Lo.</em>

            common sensors, such as potentiometers, encoders, limit switches, and more. The 2011 robot was fully assembled
            with the roboRIO electrical system with all the wires now in place.</li>

        <strong>Session 3: Designing and Making Wires for 2012 Baseboard</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Students worked with veteran members in Inventor to redesign the 2012 robot's baseboard with the new roboRIO control
            system. Additionally, students began cutting, stripping, and crimping both motor controller power and PWM wires
            using the simulated wire run lengths on the CAD model.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Session 2: Crimping Wires and PWM Cables</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Working under the guidance of veteran members, students worked at multiple stations. They learned how to crimp wires
            and to make PWM cables. They also were introduced to what they are going to be doing for the next couple of weeks,
            rewire our 2012 robot's baseboard with new control system components.</li>

<h4>
    <strong>Computer Aided Design</strong>
</h4>
<p>Our fall CAD workshop series helps new members learn to use Autodesk Inventor to make basic parts and assemblies. Students
    develop skills that are useful for robot design and machining in the build season.
    <br>
    <cite>Presented by students Amrita Iyer, Ria Pradeep, and Rahul Iyer.</cite>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 5:&nbsp;</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>We went over how to import parts (specifically a pneumatic cylinder and its accompanying rod pin) from
            <strong>&nbsp;
                <a href="http://mcmaster.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" data-referer-safe="1" data-mce-href="http://mcmaster.com/">mcmaster.com</a>. </strong>We worked with taking apart solid bodies on the cylinder, and about making assemblies
            on our own. Finally, we created our own solid bodies from a singular part and experimented with shelling out
            those bodies.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 4: Making Machinist Drawings</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We went over how to make machinist drawings, including how to place base components and how to annotate the drawing.
                Then we experimented with the CAD model revolutions and made new parts using this feature.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 3: Making Parts</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>In this workshop we went over how to make parts from scratch in Inventor. We started by making our own 2D sketches
            of a c-channel part and then learned how to extrude the sketch and other features/holes into a 3D model.
            <br>

    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 2: Making Assemblies</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>We went over the basics of SVN, including what it means to add, commit, and update files. We started using Inventor
            and students were first given a quick run-through on how to use the software. We then led students through constructing
            a CAD assembly of a simple robot drivetrain model and taught them how to use the different types of constraints
            for holding parts together in an assembly.

        <strong>Session 1: Installing Autodeks Inventor and Tortoise SVN</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>This workshop was an install "party" where we helped students download and install Inventor Professional 2016 and
            Tortoise SVN.

<h4>
    <strong> Machining </strong>
</h4>
<p>The machining workshops teach members how to use various machines in our room such as the Lathe and CNC. It provides students
    with skills such as interpreting machinist drawings to make parts.

        <ul>
            <li>This week, students continued working on their sample parts and learned about drilling holes and deburr-ing .
                Most students had already center drilled their holes, so we had them practice edge-finding again, then had
                them finish drilling and deburr-ing their parts. In the end, everyone who came was able to finish their parts.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Session 4:</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>This session, members continued to work on their projects. throughout the day they learned all the basics of
                drilling. They learned how to place a drill chuck in the spindle securely. They also learned how to identify
                and find the correct drill for a part, and how to place that drill into the chuck. In addition, they learned
                how to use a center drill. The members then began to work on drilling holes into their parts, and they will
                finish that up next session.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 3:</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>This past Monday on November 2, we held our third session of machining workshops. The members continued working on
            their projects. They got some more practice with setting up a job on a mini-mill, and they also got to practice
            facing and milling to the standards that we expect. Furthermore, they also learned how to use the deburr wheel
            to remove burrs so that they can precisely measure their parts. Next session they will continue to work on their
            parts.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 2:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>At the start of the session we went over climb milling and conventional milling which are two important concepts
            in machining that describe the way a cut is taken. Then the students were taught how to take a rough cut on the
            bandsaw based on the length of the part they needed. In addition, they learned how to change tools on the mini-mills,
            and learned the basics of milling to length on the mills. The students then proceeded to get started on their
            individual projects which they will continue to work on next session.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session 1: </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Today was the first session of machining workshops. First we introduced the members to all the machines in the workshops,
            told them the purpose of the machines and we introduced them to basic safety on those machines. We then proceeded
            to introduce the students to the basics of the bandsaw. They all took turns practicing cutting a piece and changing
            the level of the guard on the bandsaw. After that we introduced them to the mini-mills. We taught them what an
            endmill was and the basics of cutting. We then showed them how to turn the machine on and off, how to jog the
            axes, how to use the readouts, and how to mill a part. For the remainder of the session we had them practice
            milling a part, and at the end of the session they cleaned up their work area.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h4>
    <strong>Software </strong>
</h4>
<p>Teaches new members fundamentals of robot programming. In these workshops, students learn concepts such as state machines
    and control loops that are directly applicable to controlling robot hardware.
