<h1>Community Outreach</h1><p>Community outreach is a great way to spread the message of <em>FIRST</em> and inspire the community with science and technology. There are many ways for a team to influence their community.</p>

<h3><em>FIRST</em> Lego League</h3><p>FLL is another division of <em>FIRST</em> for younger children. Mentoring local FLL teams is a great way for a team to spread science and technology to younger children in the community.</p>

<h3>Company Demonstrations</h3><p>Robot demonstrations at nearby companies are a great way to spread <em>FIRST</em> throughout the community. Teams can contact their sponsors to schedule a demonstration at their campus.</p>
