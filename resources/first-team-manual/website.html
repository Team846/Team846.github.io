<h1>Website</h1><p>A team website is a very important tool to communicate with members and publicize the team.</p>

<h3>Website Design</h3><p>The design of a website is very important to ensure that visitors enjoy looking at each page. &nbsp;Things to keep in mind are font size, line spacing, and color contrast.</p>

<p>HTML and CSS validation are also very important to ensure quality of the webpage. &nbsp;The W3C Validator can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/" data-mce-href="http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/">http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/</a>.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3><p>The back-end of a website determines how fast and stable a website is. &nbsp;Lynbrook Robotics uses its own CMS built from scratch that we believe fits best for the purposes of our website. &nbsp;As a result, each of our pages loads extremely fast and allows for great expansibility.</p>

<h3>Content</h3><p>Perhaps the most important part of a website is what is written in it. &nbsp;With well-written content, information is displayed clearly and professionally. &nbsp;Lynbrook Robotics maintains our content through member involvement in writing articles and pages.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3><p>To ensure that the website recovers quickly from technical difficulties, we have created a website team that constantly takes problems about the website from other members and promptly fixes it. &nbsp;A website team must understand the entire back-end of the website extremely well, as well as stay readily accessible by other members.</p>

<h3>Website Awards</h3><p>Every year&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;recognizes well-maintained websites with two different awards. &nbsp;The website excellence award is given to all teams with a website that meet a certain criteria. &nbsp;The best website award is given during regionals to the team with the most well-maintained <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;website.</p>

<p>The criteria for <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;websites can be found <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FRC/Game_and_Season__Info/2012_Assets/2012%20website%20criteria%20section%20of%20team%20manual.pdf" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FRC/Game_and_Season__Info/2012_Assets/2012%20website%20criteria%20section%20of%20team%20manual.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
