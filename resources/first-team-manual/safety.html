<h1>Safety</h1><p><img style="float: right" title="" src="/uploads/media/2012/09/Safety-Monkey-Colored.png" alt="Safety Monkey" width="" height="300" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2012/09/Safety-Monkey-Colored.png" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p>

<p>Maintaining a safety procedure is very important to ensure the safety of each participating member during build season. &nbsp;A good procedure includes making sure members know all the rules, having a checklist for approved members on each machine, as well as verifying each member's medical conditions.</p>

<p>To do this, Lynbrook Robotics has created a safety system on our website where we have all members read over and sign the rules of our workshop, as well as store their medical information. &nbsp;We have also created a safety manual with rules and guidelines about each machine. &nbsp;Our safety manual also includes a checklist of approved members for each machine.</p>
