<h3>Tips for Planning Events</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Start early</li>
    <li>Find out what needs to be brought on the day of the event</li>
    <li>Predetermine number of rides</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>The use of a project management software and version control software is very important to ensure that a team meets deadlines.
    &nbsp;A project management software provides a very clear timeline of tasks and bugs, helping a team plan their build
    season effectively. &nbsp;Some project management software include PTC Windchill, Trac, and Redmine.</p>
<p>Version control makes it a lot easier for multiple members on a team to work together on one aspect of the robot. &nbsp;It
    also keeps a revision log in case a reversion is needed. &nbsp;There are many version control software available, including
    as Subversion (SVN), Git, Concurrent Versions System (CVS), and Mercurial.</p>
<p>Lynbrook Robotics uses Redmine, a project management software that supports SVN and Git. &nbsp;We use SVN for version controlling
    our robot design, C++ code, as well as miscellaneous documents.</p>
<p>To use a version control system, a team must use a host to serve the repositories or host it on their own web server. There
    are many free online private hosts, including
    <a href="http://code.google.com/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>,
    <a href="http://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>,
    <a href="http://www.projectlocker.com/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.projectlocker.com/">ProjectLocker</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>.&nbsp;Lynbrook Robotics stores our repositories and hosts SVN on our own web server which also runs this
    website.</p>
<h3>Build Season Scheduling</h3>
<p>To make sure a team completes their robot on time before stop build day, a strict schedule must be maintained. &nbsp;Lynbrook
    Robotics uses this schedule:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Week 1</strong>: Design Discussions</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Weeks 2 and 3</strong>: Computer Aided Designing</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Weeks 4 and 5</strong>: Machining and Assembly</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Week 4 to 1st Regional</strong>: Software Development</li>
</ol>
