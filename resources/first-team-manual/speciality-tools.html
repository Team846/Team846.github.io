<h1>Cool Specialty Tools<br></h1><p>These specialty tools are the not-so-obvious solution to some tough problems on our <em>FIRST</em> robots.&nbsp; Each are proven and we regard them highly. We keep them ready in our Funky Monkey tool chest.<br></p>

<p><img style="float: right; clear: both" src="/uploads/media/2012/01/DarkSoul-stockphoto-e1325694891103.png" alt="DarkSoul #25 ChainBreaker" width="150" data-mce-src="../uploads/media/2012/01/DarkSoul-stockphoto-e1325694891103.png" data-mce-style="float: right;"></p>

<h3>Dark Soul #25 Chain Breaker Tool<br></h3><p>The <strong>Dark Soul Chain Breaker Tool</strong> is the best tool we've found for breaking and rejoining #25 roller chain. Not only very effective, it's the most stylish tool in our box!<br></p>

<p>The Dark Soul Chain Breaker Tool can be hard to find, and costs over $30.&nbsp; Second place award is the <strong>Pitsco Chain Breaker Tool</strong>, at <a href="http://www.pitsco.com/" data-mce-href="http://www.pitsco.com">Pitsco.com</a> which gets the job done for a lot less $$.&nbsp; Both of these tools are much more effective at breaking small #25 chain than the commonly sold #25-#60 Roller Chain Breaker.&nbsp; Remember that the chain number (in this case #25) does matter when using a chain breaker.</p>

<h3>DC Clamp-on Ammeter (Craftsman 82369 / Extech MA220 )</h3><div style="float: right; clear: both" data-mce-style="float: right; clear: both;"><div class="captioned"><img title="Craftsman 82368" src="/uploads/media/2013/08/SearsDCAmpMeter82369.jpg" alt="Craftsman Digital Clamp-On Ammeter 82368" width="149" height="149" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2013/08/SearsDCAmpMeter82369.jpg"><div>Craftsman 82369 DC Ammeter</div>

</div></div>
<p>These DC clamp ammeters are excellent for Robotics!&nbsp; They have two ranges of DC current: <strong>40A</strong> and <strong>400A</strong> with a 10mA/100mA resolution.&nbsp; Use them to check your drivetrain motors for friction by comparing motor currents, or check your electrical system's ability to deliver hundreds of amps when your robot is in a pushing match!<br></p>

<p>Aside from the color, these two meters appear to be identical, but the Sears Craftsman is $55 and the Extech is about $110. Note that <strong>other clamp meters in this price range can't measure DC current</strong> -- they can only measure AC current.&nbsp; The small range indicators make this meter harder to read than many&nbsp;<em>Digital MultiMeters</em> (DMM), but the DC clamp current measurement feature, together with its low price make this meter essential for your robotics tool box.<br></p>

<h3>Battery Cable Crimper</h3><p>This battery cable crimpler makes attaching terminals to your heavy AWG #6 wires easy!&nbsp; One gratifying whack with a three pound hammer, and you've got a reliable connection! You can find these at online stores like <a href="http://mcmaster.com/" data-mce-href="http://mcmaster.com/">McMaster</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" data-mce-href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> for prices ranging from $16 to $30.&nbsp; We purchased our <em>Molex</em> branded crimper from McMaster for $30. <br></p>

<h3>GWS MT-1 PWM Signal Generator &amp; Reader + Tachometer<br></h3><div class="captioned" style="float: right; clear:both" data-mce-style="float: right;"><img title="GWS MT-1" src="/uploads/media/2013/08/aux_mt-1+servo.jpg" alt="GWS MT-1 Servo Tester" width="226" height="108" data-mce-src="uploads/media/2013/08/aux_mt-1+servo.jpg"><div>GWS MT-1 Servo Tester</div>
</div><p>The <em>GWS MT-1 RC Multiple Tester</em> allows you to operate your&nbsp; electronic speed controllers, or <strong>ESC</strong>s, whether they are <strong><em>Jaguars</em></strong>, <strong><em>Talons</em></strong>,&nbsp; <strong><em>Victors</em></strong>, or servos, without waiting for your software and electrical systems to be completed.&nbsp; It's great for operating prototype setups of your robot's shooters and conveyor systems.<br></p>

<p>In addition to <strong>sending PWM</strong> command signals to your ESC's, the GWS MT-1 can <strong>read servo-type PWM</strong> command signals (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control#Pulse_duration" data-mce-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control#Pulse_duration">Servo_control at Wikipedia</a> ).&nbsp; Whether sending or receiving, the PWM pulse width is reported in microseconds.&nbsp; It even has an optical <strong>tachometer</strong>, which you can use to read your motor's speeds. The operation of the MT-1 tester is a bit tricky, with a confusing interface, but it is one powerful tester.&nbsp; The GWS MT-1 can be found online at hobby stores for about $25.&nbsp; Wow!<br></p>
